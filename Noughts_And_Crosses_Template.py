General Rules
=============

0. READ THE RULES FIRST.
1. Read the challenge carefully
2. The thread containing the challenge details is only for seeking clarification about the challenge. Do not share your code.
3. Each participant should create their own thread, one only, to share their work in progress, share their own 
   progress comments and discuss their code with the group.
4. Facebook is rubbish at sharing code. Use something like Pastebin or GIT.
5. Since there is no prize there is no cheating, however if you re-use code, give credit. Plagiarism is frowned upon
6. You have as much leeway in deciding how to approach and code the programs as you wish. However, give consideration
   to producing efficient, readable and elegant code.
7. Any code you write is yours, but by taking part you allow others to read, keep, and learn from your code. This does 
   not constitute a formal 'licence' as we are not lawyers and we're not getting mired in Intellectual Property.

Challenge 8

Noughts and Crosses

Noughts and Crosses, or 'Tic Tac Toe' to our American cousins, is a two-player game which can be played using pen
and paper. Using three by three grid, each player takes turns in placing their mark (a captial 'O' or a capital
'X') in a free position on the grid. The objective was to create a line of three Os or Xs to win, or to stop the
opponent winning forcing a stalemate. Those lines can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. All very simple.

The Challenge is to create a two player version of the game. Normally I'd set two different options, but I think
it's time for everyone to do the same thing: Create an AI player. 

At the end, you should be able to play 2 human players, 1 human/1AI and 2 AI players

Build your game in this order, to make things easier:

1) Create the code to display the game: The board with placements, score (won games), who's turn it is etc
2) Create the code to take the moves from the players, validate them and update the board
3) Create the code for the AI.

Now, as far as I can see, there are two ways to create the AI: 

Brute force every possible game move and decide on the next move based on the current game state and selecting the
next move based on the best probability of a win, or:
Pick an initial desired winning state and play to win that game, adjusting the game (including picking a new
winning state) and responding to the second player.

Try it, step by step. It'll be fun.

If you feel particularly bold, work with another participant, create your own AIs and have them play each other!
